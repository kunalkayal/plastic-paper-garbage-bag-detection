## 🌟 Overview
This project is an advanced image classification model designed to categorize carry bag images into three distinct classes:

- **Garbage Bag**
- **Plastic Bag**
- **Paper Bag**

The model is trained using a Kaggle dataset and leverages deep learning techniques to achieve remarkable accuracy. By identifying bag types, this project contributes to efficient waste management and recycling efforts.
